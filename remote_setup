  Can use either GIT GUI, Putty or OpenSSH for generating SSH keys for windows


Setup Windows
  Download the latest OpenSSH for Windows binaries (package OpenSSH-Win32.zip)
  Extract the package to C:\Program Files\OpenSSH
  As the Administrator, install SSHD and ssh-agent services: 
  powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-sshd.ps1
  As the Administrator, generate server keys by running the following commands from the C:\Program Files\OpenSSH: 
  .\ssh-keygen.exe -A
  Open a port for the SSH server in Windows Firewall:
  Either run the following PowerShell command (Windows 8 and 2012 or newer only), as the Administrator: 
  New-NetFirewallRule -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 22 -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -DisplayName SSH
  or go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules and add a new rule for port 22.
  To allow a public key authentication, as an Administrator, from C:\Program Files\OpenSSH, run: 
  powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-sshlsa.ps1 
  and restart the machine
  Start the service and/or configure automatic start:
  Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools and open Services. Locate SSHD service.
  If you want the server to start automatically when your machine is started: Go to Action > Properties. In the Properties dialog, change Startup type to Automatic and confirm.
  Start the SSHD service by clicking the Start the service.
